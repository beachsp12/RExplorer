1. "index.html": This is the main HTML file that will contain the structure of the website. It will include references to the CSS files for styling. It will contain various DOM elements with unique id names that can be targeted by JavaScript functions if needed.

2. "styles.css": This is the main CSS file that will contain custom styles for the website. It will be linked from the index.html file and will target the id names of the DOM elements defined there.

3. "tailwind.css": This is the CSS file for Tailwind, a utility-first CSS framework. It will be linked from the index.html file and will provide base styles for the website. It will also target the id names of the DOM elements defined in the index.html file.

Shared Dependencies:

1. DOM Element IDs: These are unique identifiers for elements within the HTML file. Both the "styles.css" and "tailwind.css" files will target these IDs to apply styles.

2. CSS Classes: These are identifiers that can be used to target multiple elements at once. Both the "styles.css" and "tailwind.css" files will use these classes to apply styles.

3. HTML Elements: These are the actual elements (like div, p, h1, etc.) defined in the "index.html" file. Both the "styles.css" and "tailwind.css" files will target these elements to apply styles.

4. CSS Selectors: These are the patterns used to select the element(s) you want to style. Both the "styles.css" and "tailwind.css" files will use these selectors to apply styles.

5. Link to CSS files: The "index.html" file will have links to both the "styles.css" and "tailwind.css" files, allowing it to use the styles defined in these files.
